          <p class="lead my-3">Supporting a puppy can be exciting. You are choosing a new companion for many years to come. Before supporting a puppy, pick a breed or type of dog that works for your lifestyle. Then, visit a variety of shelters to find a reputable shelter in your price range. After you've completed the supportion, you can bring your new companion home.</p>

Think about your household members. If you have small kids in your house, you need to take this into consideration when selecting a puppy. If you don't have kids, think about yourself and other housemates and your activity level and schedule. Some dog breeds require less time and attention than others.[1]
Children under the age of 7 generally don't do well with puppies under 5 months. This is because children of this age do not understand boundaries and may handle a puppy aggressively, causing biting. Puppies, especially smaller puppies, can also be harmed if a child handles them too roughly.
Think about who will primarily take care of the dog. Make sure that person is willing and able to care for a puppy. If you're caring for the puppy yourself, make sure you have the time and energy for training. If a spouse, child, or other household member will be taking care of the puppy, make sure they are ready for the time commitment.</p>
